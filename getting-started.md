* C# full stack work, creating and maintaining web applications - Developing liquidity and funding managment software to enable users to easily price and organize instruments efficiently, minimizing labour intensive processes, Maintanace of our ExcelAddin as well as other moderinisng inititives, including development of internal Python API using pythonNet to allow python to interface with our C# systems.
* Python data science work - Led overhaul of cumbersome excel based reports and productionised to allow  automated genertion of reports on a more frequent basis (Daily, Monthly). Implemented this via Ploomber Pipeline which also enabled better documentation more robust change control process. Additionally directed much of the upskilling/learning sessions on the above along with producing written learning materials and wikis

I graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science (Engineering), in Mechatronics Engineering, awarded with honours by the Electrical Engineering department of the University of Cape Town at the end of 2019. Courses taken covered Computer Science, Robotics, Control, Digital Signal Processing and Electrical Drives and Machines.









## Projects: 

### Interest-Rate Option Pricing Accounting For Jumps At Deterministic Times 
My Master’s Dissertation examined the modelling of interest rates for the purposes of pricing bond options, specifically taking into account random jumps of the interest rate at known points in time. This was done by researching various already existing non-jump pricing models and applying current research in short rate jump models to the application of bond options, after which models were simulated and compared numerically to assess results.

### GenieWebApp 
Coming soon,

### PloomberPipelineTemplate 
Data science template that I use as a start for most of my projects. 
Uses Ploomber to construct pipeline of tasks/steps and run end-to-end. 
Pandas for transformations and data manipulation.
Plotly for graphing.
Python-pptx for report creation
And nbconvert's pdf generation (intergarated into Ploomber) for user step-by-step process document generation.
