* Python data science work - Led overhaul of cumbersome excel based reports and productionised to allow  automated genertion of reports on a more frequent basis (Daily, Monthly). Implemented this via Ploomber Pipeline which also enabled better documentation more robust change control process. Additionally directed much of the upskilling/learning sessions on the above along with producing written learning materials and wikis

## Projects: 

### Interest-Rate Option Pricing Accounting For Jumps At Deterministic Times 
My Master’s Dissertation examined the modelling of interest rates for the purposes of pricing bond options, specifically taking into account random jumps of the interest rate at known points in time. This was done by researching various already existing non-jump pricing models and applying current research in short rate jump models to the application of bond options, after which models were simulated and compared numerically to assess results.
