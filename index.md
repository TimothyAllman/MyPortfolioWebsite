# Hi!
I'm Tim, Welcome to MyPortfolioWebsite. Here you can learn a little bit about me and what sort of code I like.
See [my background and education section](/b) if you're interested in that sort of thing, or check out the blog section for some things I've written down (mainly so that I don't forget about them later).
