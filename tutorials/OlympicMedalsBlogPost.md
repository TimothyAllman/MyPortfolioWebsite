<div class="markdown"><h1>Olympic Medals Analysis</h1></div>


<div class="markdown"><p>While watching the 2024 summer olympics with someone and looking at the medals table,  an interesting thought was pesented - what does the medals table actually show?</p></div>


<div class="markdown"><p>For those that don't know, the medals table is the "thing" that shows how many medals (gold, silver and bronze)  each country has attained. It is constructed in tabular form and ususally is presented on screen when the games  are broadcast on your local sports channel or viewing service, usually during lull periods when nothing much else is going on.</p></div>


<div class="markdown"><p>All the code for the process can be found on github here  <a href="https://github.com/TimothyAllman/OlympicsMedalsAnalysis">https://github.com/TimothyAllman/OlympicsMedalsAnalysis</a></p></div>
